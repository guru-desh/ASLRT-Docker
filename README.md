# ASLRT-Docker

This is a repository that contains the Dockerfiles to recreate three different docker containers. The first Docker container is the CopyCat-Docker container. The second Docker container is the Feature Extraction Docker container that only contains pose estimators to extract meaningful keypoints from the hands and body. The third Docker container is the Recognition Docker container that contains Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries to train a sign recognition model.

Each folder has its own README file with a more detailed description of the libraries and software inside of it.
